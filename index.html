       <h2><b>Dogs</b></h2>
       <img src="dog.jpg">
       <p>Sitting in an empty house <br>
         with a dog from the Mexican Circus! <br>
         O Daisy, embrace is my only pleasure. <br>
         Holding and hugging my friends. Education. <br>
         A wave of eucalyptus. Warm granite. <br>
         These are the things I have in my heart. <br>
         Heart and skills, there’s nothing else.  <br>
<br>
         I usually don’t like small dogs but you <br>
         like midwestern women take over the air. <br>
         You leap into the air and pivot <br>
         a diver going up! You are known <br>
         to open the fridge and eat when you wish <br>
         you can roll down car windows and step out <br>
         you know when to get off the elevator. <br>
<br>
         I always wanted to be a dog <br>
         but I hesitated <br>
         for I thought they lacked certain skills. <br>
         <i>Now I want to be a dog.</i></p>
